The main objective of this project is to distinguish the internet usage of one user is statistically distinguishable when compared to the
internet usage of the other users.  We compared the results for each time window in order to check how time window affects profiling. 


About project:
I considered the dockets and duration of each user from the given files and then we will give the path of these files in the code to
calculate the spearman coefficient and P values of these 3 time windows for week 1 and 2 where one user is compared with every other user
for all the 54 users is attached in the zip file as excel sheets and find the value of P(z) and the output must be written in the excel
format. Here, We have to caluculate the P(z) values in the interval of 10sec, 227sec and 300sec.We are given the data and the data is 
splitted in the given intervals. The date we need to take are in the range of date between 4th to 15th and we need to exclude the weekends
i.e Saturdays and Sundays. The data must be executed in the time frame between 8am to 5pm in the given intervals by calculating with the 
given function .
